# Uploading

After packaging your mod we can begin the upload process to Thunderstore. 

Before uploading let's first validate our manifest using the [manifest validator](https://thunderstore.io/tools/manifest-v1-validator/).

Copy the manifest file contents into the validator, and see if it shows you any errors:

If you did everything correctly, manifest validation should succeed.

Once the manifest validation is successfull, we can upload our mod, head over to the [upload page](https://thunderstore.io/c/palworld/create/).

On this page, select your team, choose the `Palworld` community, and add appropriate tags for your mod.

Next, click on the `Choose or drag file here` button, and choose your mod zip archive.,

After doing all the steps above, press the `Submit` button!

If you followed all the steps correctly, you should see your mod get uploaded:
